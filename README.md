# GuildsDevelopmentBuild
 The Guild Social development build! Public because open source is amazing.


DISCLAIMER: 
Guilds uses icons from the google material design icon set, the Guilds logo is commisioned and was not created by Milo Goodfellow, and background stock images are provided by pexels.com. It's of value to note as well that I have, in the past, requested that others help me solve errors in this program that I did not have the ability to solve.
